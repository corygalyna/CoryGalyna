# Hi There!
[![Cory Galynas Repositorien](artworks/logo-1200x630.svg)](https://github.com/CoryGalyna)

I am an experienced project manager with a passion for delivering high-quality
software products. With my expertise in project planning, scheduling, risk
management, and stakeholder communication, I have successfully led numerous
cross-functional teams to achieve project goals on time and within budget.


## What About My Role
As a project manager, I am committed to fostering a collaborative and inclusive work
environment. I believe that by valuing and leveraging the strengths of each team
member, we can achieve our shared goals and deliver successful projects.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, traveling, and trying out new recipes.
